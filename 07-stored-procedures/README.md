The lab is designed to teach you how to write stored procedures that insert data into several tables while maintaining transaction control across the set of insert statements. You will write an insert_contact procedure that should achieve these objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to write stored functions and procedures.</li>
  <li>Learn how to write autonomous stored functions and procedures.</li>
  <li>Learn how to write object table functions.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use transaction control language (TCL) commands to manage transaction scope.</li>
  <li>Learn how to call and test stored functions and procedures.</li>
</ul>
