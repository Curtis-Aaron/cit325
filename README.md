# cit325
This repository is dedicated to Oracle PL/SQL scripting projects written for the CIT 325 Database Programming class taught by Brother McLaughlin at BYU-Idaho during the Fall 2017 Semester.

Each student was provided a Fedora image containing an operational Oracle environment, and all commands were executed using the SQLPlus command line interface.
