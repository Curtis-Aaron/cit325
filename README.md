# cit325
This repository is dedicated to Oracle PL/SQL scripting projects written for the CIT 325 Database Programming class taught by Brother McLaughlin at BYU-Idaho during the Fall 2017 Semester.

Each student was provided a Fedora image containing an operational Oracle environment, and all commands were executed using the SQLPlus command line interface.

Links to the lab instructions are listed on the right-hand side of http://michaelmclaughlin.info/db1/ after the links to the CIT 225 lessons and labs.
