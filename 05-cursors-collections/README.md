The lab is designed to teach you how to work with cursor loops, SQL collections, and an UPDATE statement in a range for loop. The anonymous block PL/SQL program should achieve these objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Learn how to instantiate an empty collection.</li>
  <li>Learn how to extend memory space in a collection one element at a time.</li>
  <li>Learn how to assign values to a composite data type inside a collection.</li>
  <li>Learn how to use the values of a composite data type to set values and filter values in a WHERE clause.</li>
</ul>
