The lab is designed to teach you how to work with Oracleâ€™s object types, and teach you the concepts of generalization and specialization. Oracle creates object types that support collections with and without methods. Oracle object types without methods have a default constructor like tables, and they do not require the implementation of object bodies. Oracle object types with methods require you to implement object bodies, more or less, object types and bodies act like PL/SQL package specifications and bodies.
